Problem: The error `E: The repository 'file:/cdrom noble Release' no longer has a Release file.` indicates that the system's package source list is referring to a CD-ROM repository missing the necessary 'Release' file. This can occur if the CD-ROM is outdated or not properly mounted.

Solution: 
- Remove the CD ROM:
    Open the `/etc/apt/sources.list` file: `sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list`
    Comment out the line starting with `deb file:/cdrom` by adding a `#` at the beginning.
    Save and exit the editor.
    Run `sudo apt update` to refresh the package lists.
    Run `sudo dpkg --configure -a`

- Keep CD ROM:
    Ensure that the CD-ROM/ISO is correctly mounted and contains the 'Release' file.
    If the issue persists, consider using an updated medium or switch to online repository sources.
